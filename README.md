# Hearth

A clean and customizable browser homepage, built with ReactJS.

The homepage source is in the `homepage` folder.

It's prepackaged into a chrome extension, but it can easily be ported to any other browser.

In fact, you can configure your browser to point your homepage to https://chrome-better-home.web.app/. All user data is (locally) persisted automatically, so you can customize it however you want, and your data never leaves your computer!
